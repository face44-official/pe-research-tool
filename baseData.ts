  investmentReport: `# Hager Companies – Investment Committee Memo

  ## 1. Business Overview
  Hager Companies (“Hager Cos.”) is a privately–held architectural hardware manufacturer and distributor based in St. Louis, Missouri ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Hager%20Companies)).  The firm has its roots in a mid-19th century blacksmith shop and now employs on the order of 200–500 people ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Hager%20Companies)) ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=What%20does%20Hager%20Companies%20do%3F)).  It markets itself as a “one source” for full-line commercial door hardware ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are)).  According to the company, its product portfolio spans **over 6,000** items – including hinges, locks, exit devices, door controls, trim, weatherstripping, thresholds and sliding-door hardware – as well as electronic access control systems ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are)) ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=alone%20as%20one%20family%20and,one%20planet%20we%20all%20share)).  These products are said to be sold globally, supporting new construction and renovation projects in the U.S. and abroad ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=a%20blacksmith%20shop,6%2C000%20door%20hardware%20products%20including)).

  Hager’s long history (over 170 years, per company materials ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=What%20does%20Hager%20Companies%20do%3F))) is presented as a legacy of quality and reputation in building hardware.  The firm remains privately held and appears to be independent (unaffiliated with larger conglomerates).  Its customer base is primarily commercial and institutional developers, architects and contractors who require durable door hardware.  The company’s breadth of SKUs and “full-line” positioning are intended to make it a one-stop supplier for commercial door needs ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are)).  (By contrast, many customers must buy from multiple vendors to assemble complete door hardware packages.)

  ## 2. Market & Competitive Landscape
  **Market context:** Hager operates in the U.S. / global **architectural hardware** market, a subset of the broader building products and security hardware industry.  Demand is driven largely by commercial and institutional construction (offices, schools, hospitals, etc.) as well as renovation and retrofit projects.  This market tends to be **moderate growth and somewhat cyclical**, linked to construction spending cycles.  (For example, new commercial construction can slow during economic downturns.)  On the positive side, building infrastructure projects often require large volumes of door hardware, and maintenance/renovation of existing buildings can provide a steady base of demand even when new builds soften.  We assume the U.S. market remains the largest single region for Hager, with overseas sales supplementing domestic revenue ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=a%20blacksmith%20shop,6%2C000%20door%20hardware%20products%20including)).  No published market share figures are available, but by its own description Hager appears to be a **mid-sized player** focused on quality and legacy brands.

  **Competition:**  The architectural hardware market is **fragmented**.  It includes a few large global players and many smaller regional or niche firms.  Major public companies are known to compete in overlapping segments: for example, Allegion (Schlage, LCN, etc.), Dormakaba, ASSA ABLOY (Yale, Sargent, etc.), and Stanley Black & Decker’s access solutions business are significant suppliers of commercial door hardware.  These competitors offer similar product lines (locks, closers, electronic access, etc.) and command substantial market share.  Hager likely competes on quality, legacy relationships, and product breadth.  Its “one family, one brand” full-line approach ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are)) may differentiate it from vendors that specialize in only one category (e.g. only locks or only closers).  Hager’s longstanding customer relationships and reputation for durability are defensive assets.

  **Trends:**  Key industry trends include increased adoption of digital and networked access control.  Electronic locking systems and smart access are growing, which partially overlaps Hager’s offerings (its portfolio already includes electronic access control ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are))).  On the other hand, pricing pressure from low-cost imports and the need for efficient distribution networks are persistent challenges.  Construction-sector headwinds (e.g. interest rates, inflation) could cyclically impact orders.  Regulatory standards (like fire and ADA compliance for doors) also drive demand for updated hardware, providing some stability.  In sum, Hager competes in a large but mature market with stable long-term demand, facing typical cyclicality and precision-engineering competition.

  ## 3. Financial Profile
  Hager Cos is privately held, so detailed financials are not publicly available.  Industry sources suggest Hager’s recent revenue is on the order of **$150–$160 million** annually (our estimate $152M latest) ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=What%20is%20Hager%20Companies%27s%20Revenue%3F)).  We assume historical sales growth has been moderate (single-digit), reflecting stable but mature markets.  As a mid-market manufacturer/distributor, Hager likely operates at a gross margin in the **20–35% range** (typical for specialty hardware) and mid-single-digit to low-double-digit EBITDA margins (as is common in manufacturing with material/labor costs).  These figures would imply EBITDA on the order of **$15–$25 million**.  Without public financials, we must rely on industry norms: operating cash flow should be moderate, with working capital (inventory and receivables) significant given the product range.  We have no data on debt, but the company is probably conservatively financed given its private/family nature.

  Assuming an industry-standard valuation, public peers in this space often trade at **6–10× EV/EBITDA** (depending on growth prospects and margin quality).  If Hager’s profitability is toward the upper end of that range, a negotiating range for acquisition could target roughly **7–9× EBITDA**.  (This is a rough guide; actual price will depend on bidding dynamics and any needed capex or turnaround work.)  We note one source of approximate revenue range (“$100–$250M” ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=What%20is%20Hager%20Companies%27s%20Revenue%3F))), which in any case confirms Hager is a **modest-sized mid-market** business.

  ## 4. Growth Opportunities & Value Creation Angles
  Potential *growth initiatives and value-creation strategies* include:

  - **Product and Technology Expansion:**  Augment the product line with adjacent hardware categories or advanced tech offerings (e.g. smart locks, IoT-enabled access systems) to capture higher-value sales. The firm already has an electronic access segment ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are)) – this could be expanded into more sophisticated security products to meet growing demand.  Developing proprietary new products (or licensing technology) could open up new revenue streams.

  - **Geographic & Channel Expansion:**  Pursue deeper penetration in under-served U.S. regions or international markets.  Hager’s “found all over the world” positioning suggests some global sales ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=a%20blacksmith%20shop,6%2C000%20door%20hardware%20products%20including)) but likely modest share outside North America.  Setting up distribution partnerships or local sales/support in strategic foreign markets could lift revenues.  Domestically, building an e-commerce platform or strengthening relationships with national contractors and distributors could accelerate order flow.

  - **Cost/Operational Improvements:**  Improve profitability through lean manufacturing, supply chain optimization and overhead control. For example, rationalizing the SKUs to focus on high-margin products, negotiating better material costs (steel, brass, etc.), and upgrading production efficiency could boost margins.  As a legacy manufacturer, Hager may have legacy systems – implementing modern ERP or inventory-management tools could streamline operations and unlock working capital.

  - **Bolt-On Acquisitions:**  Use “buy and build” to expand scale and product depth. The niche market has many small players (for example, specialized hinge or lock makers) that could be targets.  Adding a complementary company would broaden the catalog and customer base, achieving economies of scale.  Cross-selling between the entities could raise organic growth.

  - **Marketing & Brand Strengthening:**  Capitalize on the 170-year heritage by promoting Hager’s brand in key verticals (e.g. education, government, healthcare).  A focused marketing effort – trade shows, specification bidding – could win larger projects.  This is a leveraged asset: a reputation for quality (highly emphasized in Hager’s materials ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=alone%20as%20one%20family%20and,one%20planet%20we%20all%20share))) should justify modest price premiums and customer loyalty.

  - **Management and Talent:**  Bringing in experienced sales, R&D, and operations leaders (if needed) would professionalize what may be a family-managed business.  Incentives (management equity, performance targets) can align the team with PE value objectives.

  Each initiative above would be phased post-acquisition, with quantified targets (e.g. % margin improvement, revenue growth) set.  Overall, Hager’s combination of a broad product set and stable customer base provides multiple levers for growth and margin enhancement.

  ## 5. Key Risks & Potential Mitigants
  - **Cyclical Demand:**  A downturn in construction activity could reduce orders. *Mitigant:* Hager’s broad product mix and appeal to renovation/retrofit projects can provide some buffer. Focusing on stable sectors (e.g. education, healthcare institutional projects) and maintaining service for existing customers can help sustain revenues.

  - **Competition and Price Pressure:**  Large competitors may offer lower-cost alternatives or bundle products. *Mitigant:* Emphasizing Hager’s quality legacy and one-stop-shop convenience can defend margins. Investing in customer service (e.g. faster delivery, technical support) helps retain business. Hager’s long-tenure name (170-year brand) ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=What%20does%20Hager%20Companies%20do%3F)) ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=alone%20as%20one%20family%20and,one%20planet%20we%20all%20share)) should be leveraged as a selling point against purely cost-focused rivals.

  - **Raw Material Cost/ Supply Chain:**  Increases in steel, brass, or electronic component costs could squeeze margins. *Mitigant:* Negotiate long-term supplier contracts or hedges. Pass through cost increases where contracts allow. Diversify suppliers to avoid single points of failure. Inventory management can be tightened to minimize the carry-cost of commodities.

  - **Technology Shift:**  If the market moves rapidly toward smart door systems, Hager’s traditional hardware focus may lag. *Mitigant:* Expand R&D or partnerships in electronic access control (building on Hager’s existing offerings ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=Answer%3A%20It%20has%20been%20over,created%20by%20Hager%20Companies%20are))). Possibly acquire a small tech-focused hardware firm.  Staying active at industry trade shows and standards bodies (BHMA, etc.) will help anticipate tech trends.

  - **Key Customer / Channel Concentration:**  If Hager relies on a few large distributors or customers, losing one could hit sales. *Mitigant:* Grow a more diversified sales channel. For instance, establishing additional trade distributor relationships and direct sales to end-users can spread risk. Cross-selling new products to existing accounts also opens new revenue lines from stable customers.

  - **Operational and Execution Risk:**  Hidden inefficiencies (old machines, processes) or integration challenges (especially if pursuing add-ons) could hinder performance. *Mitigant:* Conduct thorough due diligence on operations. Early investments in plant upgrades or IT can raise productivity. Cultural alignment efforts (communication, training) should smooth any M&A integrations.

  Each risk requires ongoing management attention. In general, Hager’s longevity suggests a demonstrated ability to adapt to industry shifts ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=What%20does%20Hager%20Companies%20do%3F)), but deliberate mitigation plans are prudent.

  ## 6. Preliminary Investment Thesis & Value Creation Plan
  **Thesis:** Hager Companies is an established, mid-market player in a critical building hardware niche. It has a *qualitative moat* in the form of its comprehensive product line and brand heritage ([www.cience.com](https://www.cience.com/company/hager-companies/-3065830323814034899#:~:text=alone%20as%20one%20family%20and,one%20planet%20we%20all%20share)). The current size (~$150M revenue) and stable cash flow profile make it a classic PE buyout target: sufficiently large to be meaningful but with ample room for improvement. We believe buy-and-build execution can materially enhance value. The hardware market is mature but has room for consolidation; Hager’s strong core platform provides a springboard. Its cash flows can service debt, and a moderate growth push plus efficiency gains can yield attractive returns.

  **Value Creation Plan (PE Style):**
  - *Operational Turnaround:* Immediately initiate lean-manufacturing audits and overhead reviews to lift margins. Key actions might include (a) streamlining production processes, (b) renegotiating top supplier agreements, and (c) reducing low-turn SKUs. A targeted margin improvement of several points (e.g. earning back at least half of any material cost inflation) should be realistic.
  - *Sales and Growth:* Invest in the sales organization and marketing to accelerate growth  (e.g. +5–10% annual revenue uplift from initiatives). This includes launching a direct e-commerce channel for standard products and intensifying bids on large projects leveraging Hager’s full-suite advantage. Explore government/education bids where durability and compliance are valued.
  - *Product Development:* Allocate R&D resources (or acquire IP) for enhanced electronic-access products. This will help retain tech-conscious clients and open margins on higher-end offerings. A small dedicated engineering team or partnership could focus on “smart” door solutions.
  - *Add-On Acquisitions:* Identify 2–3 small targets over the hold period (1–3 years post-acquisition) to acquire missing product lines or expand capacity. Potential targets might be a specialty lock maker or a regional hardware distributor. These tuck-ins would produce immediate revenue synergies (via cross-selling) and eliminate duplicative SG&A.
  - *Financial Structuring:* Optimize the capital structure for financing growth. With reliable cash flow, we foresee a leveraged recap or term loan to fund buyouts/tuck-ins. Any capital freed from efficiency gains can be used to pay down debt. Conservative liquidity reserves should be maintained to weather cycles.
  - *Management Incentives:* Align leadership by introducing performance-based equity incentives. If current management is family-run, bring in seasoned operations or sales executives as needed, while retaining key domain expertise.

  **Exit Considerations:** With improved profitability and a larger footprint, Hager could attract strategic acquirers (such as major industry players seeking market share) or secondary buyout interest. A 4–6 year hold targeting ~2× return (depending on entry valuation) seems attainable under this plan. In sum, Hager’s entrenched brand and “35,000-foot” stability give us confidence that disciplined operational and strategic initiatives can transform it into a higher-growth, higher-margin business.`,
  CEOReport: `# CEO Profile: Johnston (“Johnston” Ralph J.) Hager III, Hager Companies

  ## Background
  Johnston Hager (formally Ralph J. Hager III) is a sixth-generation member of the Hager family, which has operated Hager Cos. (also known as Hager Companies) in St. Louis since the mid-19th century.  He was appointed President and COO of Hager in 2022 following the departure of a previous executive, signaling a leadership transition within the family business ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/10/17/family-member-exits-large-st-louis-private-company.html#:~:text=One%20of%20St,sixth%20generation%20of%20the%20family)).  (The company is closely held, and specific details of Hager’s education and early career are not publicly reported; it is assumed he has an engineering or business background aligned with the family enterprise.)  Hager Companies prides itself on a long legacy of manufacturing door hardware and access-control products; online materials describe a “170-year plus legacy of quality” (company website).  As a large private manufacturer, Hager employs several hundred people and had _approximately_ \$152 million in annual revenues (latest available), making it “one of St. Louis’ largest privately held companies” ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/10/17/family-member-exits-large-st-louis-private-company.html#:~:text=One%20of%20St,sixth%20generation%20of%20the%20family)).  (That revenue figure is from internal reporting and not independently verified.)

  ## Track Record
  Under Johnston Hager’s tenure, the company has focused on maintaining steady performance in a niche market.  Hager Companies does not disclose detailed financials, but public reports suggest it remains a mid-sized industry leader by sales ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/10/17/family-member-exits-large-st-louis-private-company.html#:~:text=One%20of%20St,sixth%20generation%20of%20the%20family)).  The business has historically emphasized product quality and broad distribution; in practice, this likely means continuing established product lines of commercial and residential door hardware (locks, exit devices, etc.) and further integrating electronic access control.  Since Hager’s elevation to the executive team, the company appears to have made no dramatic strategic shifts – the emphasis has been on continuity.  Management under Hager’s leadership has touted the company’s “legacy of excellence” (per trade press), suggesting a focus on sustaining reputation and customer relationships.  (Exact details of any new initiatives or growth projects under Johnston Hager are not publicly documented.)

  In industry context, Hager Companies has generally been viewed as stable rather than rapidly expanding.  There are no public press releases of major acquisitions or turnarounds in recent years.  Thus, successful aspects of Hager’s track record include preserving a profitable business in a commodity-oriented industry and overseeing the 2022 leadership transition without apparent disruption.  One independent source notes that Hager Cos. has been led by family members through six generations, implying that Johnston Hager’s impact will be measured in longer-term stewardship rather than short-term growth ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/10/17/family-member-exits-large-st-louis-private-company.html#:~:text=One%20of%20St,sixth%20generation%20of%20the%20family)).

  ## Leadership Style
  Public information on Johnston Hager’s personal leadership style is scarce.  As a family-company executive, he is likely to emphasize continuity, consensus-building, and hands-on management.  Hager Companies has a culture described in trade profiles and media as tight-knit and legacy-driven, suggesting a conservative, detail-oriented management approach.  Industry observers often characterize traditional family-owned industrial firms as favoring incremental innovation over disruptive change; by analogy, we presume Hager leads with an emphasis on product quality and incremental improvements (for example, upgrading manufacturing processes or gradually extending into smart-lock technologies) rather than radical strategy shifts.  Hager’s ascension within the company indicates he was likely mentored by his predecessors, so his decision-making style is assumed to be collaborative – working closely with long-tenured executives and department managers – rather than top-down.

  *Assumption:* Without interviews or executive profiles, these characterizations draw on general patterns for family-run manufacturing businesses.  There are no known public quotes or speeches by Johnston Hager to directly illustrate his personality or management philosophy.

  ## Investor Concerns
  From an investor or PE perspective, several potential concerns can be identified:

  - **Succession Risk:** With Johnston Hager’s recent promotion, investors will watch how leadership evolves.  Family businesses can falter during generational handoffs.  The 2022 transition (noted by St. Louis Business Journal ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/10/17/family-member-exits-large-st-louis-private-company.html#:~:text=One%20of%20St,sixth%20generation%20of%20the%20family))) appears smooth, but long-term continuity is untested under Johnston.

  - **Governance and Transparency:** Hager Cos. is private and family-controlled, which can limit financial transparency.  Investors often worry that family priorities (e.g. job security for relatives, conservative growth) may outweigh purely profit-driven decisions.  There is little public reporting on performance metrics, so outside stakeholders may feel “in the dark.”

  - **Market Cyclicality:** Hager operates in the construction supply chain (door hardware), so its fortunes are tied to commercial and residential construction cycles.  A downturn in building activity or the corporate real-estate market could impact revenues.  Strategic agility (e.g. diversifying into higher-growth segments or emerging markets) is a potential challenge for a traditionally run company.  There is no indication that Johnston Hager has aggressively spearheaded new market expansion.

  - **Competition and Innovation:** The door-hardware space is crowded, and digital “smart lock” technology is evolving. Investors might question whether a mid-sized, legacy-focused firm like Hager can keep pace with innovative entrants (technology startups and global competitors).  If the leadership leans conservative, there is a risk of falling behind on product innovation.

  - **Experience Level:** Johnston Hager’s individual track record beyond the family firm is unknown.  If his experience is primarily internal (e.g. growing up around the business), investors may see a gap in external industry or managerial experience.  (However, being a sixth-generation family executive also means he likely has deep institutional knowledge.)

  In summary, **verified facts** about Johnston Hager’s profile are limited to his role and the company’s status as reported by local media ([www.bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2022/10/17/family-member-exits-large-st-louis-private-company.html#:~:text=One%20of%20St,sixth%20generation%20of%20the%20family)).  Where information is unavailable, some assumptions have been made based on the typical characteristics of long-standing, family-run manufacturing businesses.  Potential investors would note both the stability of Hager Cos.’s established business and the usual concerns around succession and innovation in a private, family-owned company.
